# Reqres API

Hi everyone, I'm Douglas a Brazilian QA.

This guide aims to explain about this repository that contains a Maven project using the Java language other dependencies such as:

- RestAssured
- JUnit

The project in question performs a check on the Reqres API request to verify that it is working as expected. The idea is that this code is executed in a CI pipeline so that at each deploy made by the development team, a job is executed validating whether the new implementations impacted the functioning of existing requests.
